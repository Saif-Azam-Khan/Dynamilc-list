This is a React functional component named App. It receives an array of articles as a prop, sorts them by upvotes and date, and renders a navigation bar with two buttons to sort the articles. When a button is clicked, the dataToShow state variable is set to either  "mostUpvoted"or "mostRescent". Then, the Articles component is rendered with the sorted version of the articles array based on the value of dataToShow.

The useState hook is used to declare a state variable called dataToShow and its setter function, which is initialized to "none".

The handleMostUpvoted and handleMostRecent functions update the dataToShow state variable when the corresponding button is clicked.

Finally, the App component is exported as the default export of the module.
